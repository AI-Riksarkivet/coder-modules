Help create a Conventional Commit following the specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

First, run `git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --stat` to show current changes.

Then follow these rules for the commit format:
**<type>[optional scope]: <description>**

**[optional body]**

**[optional footer(s)]**

**RULES:**
1. **Type is REQUIRED** (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert)
2. **Scope is OPTIONAL** - noun describing codebase section in parentheses
3. **Description is REQUIRED** - short summary in imperative present tense
4. **Breaking changes** indicated by:
   - ! after type/scope (e.g., feat!: or feat(api)!:)
   - OR BREAKING CHANGE: in footer
5. **Body is OPTIONAL** - detailed explanation (blank line after description)
6. **Footer is OPTIONAL** - uses format: token: value or BREAKING CHANGE: description

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Do NOT add any co-author information
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code"
- Do NOT add robot emojis or any Claude attribution
- Keep commit messages clean and professional
- Use lowercase for type and scope
- No period at end of description
- Description should be imperative: "add" not "added" or "adds"

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Analyze the changes shown above
2. Stage appropriate files with git add
3. Create commit with git commit -m (for single line) or heredoc for multiline
4. For multiline commits with body/footer, use:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "type(scope): description" -m "" -m "body" -m "" -m "footer"
   ```
   OR use heredoc:
   ```bash
   git commit -F- <<'END'
   type(scope): description

   body paragraph

   footer: value
   END
   ```

Please analyze the changes and create an appropriate Conventional Commit.
